Challenge: Add another UI element—a Button—to the LinearLayout view group that is contained within the ScrollView.
Make the Button appear below the article. The user would have to scroll to the end of the article to see the button. Use the
text "Add Comment" for the Button, for users to click to add a comment to the article. For this challenge, there is no need to
create a button-handling method to actually add a comment; it is sufficient to just place the Button element in the proper
place in the layout.
